# Month Seventy-Four â€“ UP 588%Â Â 

https://preview.redd.it/n00759ayy8pe1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=84b79512b1fc134b05b495e76503c8d4af5b4145

The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of:Â **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, Stellar, USDT, Litecoin, BSV,**Â andÂ **Tron**. Â 

February highlights for the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio:Â 

* Bloody month, as all cryptos end February in the red exceptÂ **Litecoin**
* **Ethereum**Â knocked out of first place byÂ **Bitcoin**, which maintains a strong overall lead since January 2019 (+2,170%).Â  Third place isÂ **Tron.**

# February Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/4pe0d81zy8pe1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c45df9d903505a45b43c0fc60faa4c7857193a

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2019:**Â After seventy-four months, 50% of the cryptos thatÂ [started in the Top Ten in January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)Â  have been knocked out.

**BSV**Â has fallen the furthest in rank so far (#92).

# February Winners and LosersÂ 

***February Winners***Â â€“Â **Litecoin**Â (+0.3%) outperformed the rest of the Top Ten by breaking even.Â Â 

***February Losers***Â â€“ Tough month for the E coins:Â **ETH**Â andÂ **EOS**Â lost -32% and -31% respectively.

# Overall Update: BTC surpasses ETH for the overall lead.Â  80% of cryptos in positive territory, EOS in the basement.

**Bitcoin**Â (+2,170% since Jan. 2019), trailingÂ **Ethereum**Â in the 2019 Portfolio for years, has now overtaken second placeÂ **ETH.**Â 

**The $100 investment into first place BTC on**Â [**January 1st, 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)Â **is currently worth $2,314.**

After seventy-four months, 80% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. The worst performer isÂ **EOS**Â (-78%)**.**

# Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/fwx03hoxz8pe1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=a57b3895f94615c9acef66f159b90d68a73d7836

There was no easy way to do so at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire cryptocurrency market sinceÂ [January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/), you would be up +2,124%

This is still behind first placeÂ **BTC**Â (+2,170%) but just barely and much better than the rest of the Top Ten cryptos, including second placeÂ **Ethereum**Â (+1,511%).Â Â 

The total market is performing much better than the Top Ten approach (+588%) as well.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:Â **$114B in**Â [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).

# Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/trhpfuryz8pe1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=0300273dcbe95ee16a96589295cd632da73ea8ef

**BitDom**Â ended February at 60.1%.

For context, here are the high and low points ofÂ **BTC**Â domination over the life of the 2019 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:Â [**38.1% in November 2022.**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46)

High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:Â [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-eight/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:

https://preview.redd.it/2dh8376109pe1.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d27b97a1ef68e7875b5e44640e4fa3c76922143

After seventy-four months, the value of the initial $1000 investment isÂ **$6,875**Â up +588%. This is down fromÂ [November 2021â€™s all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35)Â of +665% for the 2019 Portfolio.Â 

Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up +588%, it is not the best performing of the eight Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment Portfolios: it is still a distant second place behind theÂ [2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56)Â which is up +809% at the moment.

# Combining the 2018 â€“ 2025 Top Ten Crypto PortfoliosÂ 

Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, letâ€™s put all eight together now:

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +34% (total value $1,342)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +588% (total value $6,875)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +809% (total value $9,088) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +294% (total value $3,942)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up -21% (total value $793) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +162% (total value $2,619)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +48% (total value $1,483)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): up -18% (total value $816)

So overall? Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 â€“ 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,**Â the combined portfolios are worthÂ **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/0caly35b09pe1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=41a6f4795b187b6c3804a030f432e151c73bb19f

**Thatâ€™s up +237%**Â on the combined portfolios.Â  The peakÂ  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios wasÂ [**November 2021â€™s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/)Â ofÂ **+533%**.

Hereâ€™s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/b4gn25xc09pe1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb3192318ac4312f1a44ab35e776cd65dfb838a8

In summary:Â ***Thatâ€™s a +237% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500:

Iâ€™m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/1yw205ii09pe1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fd0689ede225b41ecfc11a8c7a490ea3c80d11e

Because the S&P 500 Index is up 138% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto seventy-four months ago would be worth $2,376 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 in January 2019.Â 

But what if I took the same worldâ€™s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&P 500? It would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,228 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,376 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,844 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,585 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,249 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,551 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,012 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:Â 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,095.**

That is upÂ **+64%**Â [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)Â compared to aÂ **+237%**Â gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.Â Â 

Hereâ€™s a table providing an overview of the eight year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P:Â

# Conclusion:

To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate the crypto landscape.Â  Be careful out there and donâ€™t put your mental, physical, or financial health at risk chasing gainz. If crypto is causing you to lose sleep at night, chances are you have too much in crypto: try to think long term and donâ€™t invest what you truly canâ€™t afford to lose. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for the latest progress reports.

* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): up -18% (total value $816)

So overall? Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 â€“ 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,**Â the combined portfolios are worthÂ **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/0caly35b09pe1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=41a6f4795b187b6c3804a030f432e151c73bb19f

**Thatâ€™s up +237%**Â on the combined portfolios.Â  The peakÂ  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios wasÂ [**November 2021â€™s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/)Â ofÂ **+533%**.

Hereâ€™s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/b4gn25xc09pe1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb3192318ac4312f1a44ab35e776cd65dfb838a8

In summary:Â ***Thatâ€™s a +237% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500:

Iâ€™m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/1yw205ii09pe1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fd0689ede225b41ecfc11a8c7a490ea3c80d11e

Because the S&P 500 Index is up 138% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto seventy-four months ago would be worth $2,376 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 in January 2019.Â 

But what if I took the same worldâ€™s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&P 500? It would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,228 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,376 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,844 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,585 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,249 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,551 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,012 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:Â 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,095.**

That is upÂ **+64%**Â [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)Â compared to aÂ **+237%**Â gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.Â Â 

Hereâ€™s a table providing an overview of the eight year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P:Â

2025-03-16,Bitcoinâ€™s Market Cycle: Are We in a Right- or Left-Translated Cycle?,"Bitcoin is at a crucial post-halving inflection point. Prices have surged past previous highs but now face macroeconomic uncertainty. The big question:

ðŸ‘‰ **Are we in a right-translated cycle with more upside ahead, or has Bitcoin already peaked, signaling a prolonged bear market?**

This post is based on a discussion paper I've published a few days ago ([Full read](https://nerdben.substack.com/p/bitcoin-market-cycle-right-translated) / [PDF](https://nerdben.com/20250313-MarketCycleRighLeft-DiscussionPaper.pdf)) exploring **six key macroeconomic and market indicators** shaping Bitcoinâ€™s current cycle and what they mean for future price appreciation.

# Recap on Bitcoinâ€™s Market Cycles

Bitcoin follows a **four-year cycle**, historically peaking **12-18 months post-halving**. But **this cycle is different** \- Bitcoin hit an **all-time high BEFORE the halving** for the first time ever. The current cycle (measured from the last bottom) began in early November 2022.

[Four-Year Bitcoin Market Cycles](https://preview.redd.it/myg9i7o022pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=10ce38747b85d91dfbd4cd2637fea76b28f3e019)

**I assume two market cycle scenarios:**

* **Right-Translated Cycle (Bullish)** â†’ Extended uptrend, peak closer to 2025-2026
* **Left-Translated Cycle (Bearish)** â†’ Early peak, prolonged downturn

# ðŸ”¥ So, which one are we in?

In the following let's take a look on key indicators driving Bitcoin's market cycle and examine their current trends, outlooks, and potential macroeconomic implications.

**1. M2 Global Supply (Liquidity)**

* Expanding again but slower than previous cycles
* If liquidity continues rising, it supports a **right-translated cycle**

[M2 Global Supply \(taken from 21 central banks\)](https://preview.redd.it/yuncc5l232pe1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffdf1fdca08946f6d1b638268f5a65028336af21)

**2. Core PCE Inflation (Fedâ€™s Key Inflation Measure)**

* Inflation still above 2% target but declining
* Fed policy decisions and unemployment trends will determine whether inflation stabilizes or rebounds. The risk of stagflation needs to be monitored.
* If inflation remains sticky, Fed may delay rate cuts â†’ **Left-Translated Cycle**

[Core PCE Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/frp70kgi32pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5afdeae5f6d18e5ce84f457f6834f6af2f770839)

**3. Unemployment Rate**

* Stabilized at 4.1%, but risks of job losses are rising
* Current U.S. administration's layoff policies need to be monitored (we'll know more with the upcoming jobs report on April 4, 2025)
* If inflation stays high despite rising unemployment, the Fed faces a tough choice: keep rates high, risking economic distress, or cut them to boost jobs while fueling inflation. This decision will be key to 2025's macro outlook.
* If unemployment spikes, Fed may cut rates sooner â†’ **Right-Translated Cycle**

[Unemployment Rate](https://preview.redd.it/qb6cd42742pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=85446f6e7dd379bb9e2e8d27811c9b7458952443)

**4. Fed Funds Rate**

* Rates Targets were cut to 4.50% but remain high
* If rate cuts accelerate, lending stimulation and credit expansion will increase overall liquidity in the financial system â†’ **Right-Translated Cycle**,
* If rates stay high â†’ **Left-Translated Cycle**

[Fed Funds Target Rates](https://preview.redd.it/19vu6haq42pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bc5fdf60703c5fd90fd2573156725e33f7c1073)

**5. NASDAQ Composite (Stock Market Correlation)**

* Peaked in **Dec 2024**, currently declining
* Historically, Bitcoinâ€™s price has exhibited a strong correlation with equities. A downturn in equity markets can lead to weakened investor confidence in speculative assets, increasing selling pressure on cryptocurrencies, particularly in a left-translated cycle.
* If stocks rebound â†’ Bitcoin follows (bullish)
* If stocks keep dropping â†’ Bitcoin likely enters **Left-Translated Cycle**

[NASDAQ Composite](https://preview.redd.it/nvexsp2252pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7a8583786dcfe1634bb41ae9533899ddea3c4be)

Lastly, I examined ETF Net Flows, which have been crucial this cycle and closely correlate with price action.

**6. ETF Net Flows (Institutional Demand)**

* **Net inflows turned negative in Feb 2025**
* The significant outflows observed since late February 2025 suggest waning institutional confidence in the market. If net flows remain negative for an extended period, this can serve as a bearish signal, indicating sustained selling pressure and potential downside risk.
* If inflows resume â†’ **Right-Translated Cycle**
* If outflows continue â†’ **Left-Translated Cycle**

[ETF Net Flows](https://preview.redd.it/t7fiovhr72pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=28bd484c9775f074223503953cd6fac22a756e81)

# Let's discuss the scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Left-Translated Cycle Scenario**

With Bitcoin reflecting risk-off sentiment since February 2025, the likelihood of a left-translated cycle has become increasingly relevant. In contrast to previous post-halving cycles, where Bitcoinâ€™s peak typically occurred 12â€“18 months after the halving, this scenario suggests that Bitcoin may have already reached its cycle high on January 20, 2025. By continuously delaying further rate cuts, the Fed keeps liquidity tight and weakening stock markets drag Bitcoin lower. This means, the market is about to enter a prolonged bear phase lasting up to 1.5 years, if aligning with the time frames observed in the last two cycles.

**Supporting arguments for Scenario 1:**

* **ETF adoption absorbed liquidity too early.** The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 led to massive institutional inflows in Q3 and Q4 2024. Bitcoin ETFs absorbed liquidity during a phase of expanding M2 Global Supply, creating an early demand surge that front-loaded buying pressure and was unique to this cycle.
* **Bitcoin reached an all-time high before the halving.** In all previous cycles, Bitcoinâ€™s all-time high (ATH) came 12-18 months after the halving. This cycle, Bitcoin hit an ATH at $73K$ before the April 2024 halving - a first in Bitcoinâ€™s history.
* **Liquidity tightened post-Q2 2024.** While M2 Global expanded during Q1 and Q2 2024, liquidity conditions tightened in Q3 and Q4 as the Fed maintained high interest rates and repeatedly postponed rate cuts before finally lowering rates to 475 bps in December 2024.
* **ETF netflows have turned negative.** Since February 2025, ETF Net Flows turned negative, suggesting institutions are de-risking or taking profits.
* **NASDAQ Composite and Bitcoin are showing correlated weakness.** Historically, Bitcoin has followed a risk-on/risk-off pattern with equities. The NAS- DAQ Composite peaked in Q4 2024, and since then, market sentiment has weakened.
* **Quantitative Easing is not the Fedâ€™s tool of choice.** The Fed has not signaled any immediate plans for Quantitative Easing (QE).

**Validity of Scenario 1**:

The early peak in ETF-driven demand has reduced the likelihood of a sustained post-halving rally, including a blow-off phase. Net inflows from Bitcoin ETFs turned negative in Q1 2025, indicating that institutional investors are already taking profits rather than accumulating, limiting further upside potential. In past cycles, the post-halving supply shock was a key driver of price appreciation. However, this cycle deviates from historical norms as Bitcoin peaked pre-halving, suggesting that demand was pulled forward and exhausted earlier than expected.

While the U.S. economy has avoided recession longer than anticipated, recession risks remain. A risk-off environment can further dampen institutional demand for Bitcoin, reinforcing downward price pressure. Additionally, the Fedâ€™s cautious stance has restrained speculative sentiment, preventing the retail-driven euphoria that typically characterizes late-cycle market behavior. Meanwhile, M2 Global liquidity growth has slowed, and elevated borrowing costs are constraining new debt issuance, limiting the flow of fresh capital into risk assets.

If the stock market enters a prolonged correction, Bitcoin is unlikely to decouple and may face continued selling pressure. Historical left-translated market cycles, such as the 2000 dot-com crash and the 2007 financial crisis, saw tech stocks peaking early, only to decline sharply. Bitcoin, strongly correlated with equities and representing a liquidity- sensitive asset, follows a similar trajectory.

**Scenario 2: Right-Translated Cycle Scenario**

The recent 30% decline in Bitcoinâ€™s price remains within the bounds of a typical market correction, given the assetâ€™s historically high volatility in an open and liquid market (comparable to Aprilâ€“May 2021). This does not necessarily indicate a deviation from the expected right-translated cycle structure. Based on the last two cycles, Bitcoin is projected to reach its cycle peak approximately 1,050 days after the previous market bottom, placing the expected peak in early Q4 2025. In the mid-term, supportive economic policies from the current U.S. administration, along with expected monetary easing from the Fed in early H2 2025, provide the foundation for renewed market growth.

**Supporting arguments for Scenario 2:**

* **Post-election year market weakness is historically temporary.** Historically, post-election years tend to be weak for equities from February to April before rallying in the second half of the year.
* **Historical cycle timing still leaves room for a second peak.** The past two market cycles have lasted for 12-18 months post-halving before topping out.
* **M2 Global money supply has been expanding again.** Despite a resumed growth phase in H2 2024, the M2 Global has been expanding again, increasing available liquidity.
* **Inflation is slowly decreasing towards the Fedâ€™s 2% target.** After taking a break from its rapid decrease in H2 2024, the Core PCE (YoY) is again on track reaching the Fedâ€™s target rate of 2% setting the ground for looser financial conditions.
* **Unemployment is not rising.** The Unemployment Rate has stabilized rather than surging with the labor market remaining strong enough to prevent a full economic contraction. Historically, deep bear markets require rising unemployment, which is not occurring.
* **ETF net outflows have been declining again.** Recent data shows declining outflows suggesting that at some point inflows will resume and lead to renewed institutional demand.

**Validity of Scenario 2:**

Historically, the right-translated cycle has been the base case in previous Bitcoin market cycles, following a typical 12â€“18 month post-halving rally. The current downturn in Q1 2025 appears to be seasonal rather than cyclical, largely influenced by post-election year market weakness, which has historically resolved with a recovery in the second half of the year.

Macroeconomic indicators suggest that the risk of a severe recession remains lower than feared, reducing the likelihood of further liquidity tightening. The labor market re- mains stable, with unemployment rates not surging, allowing for continued economic expansion. Additionally, inflation is steadily declining toward the Fedâ€™s 2% target, strengthening expectations for rate cuts in H2 2025. If the Fed follows through on this, looser financial conditions will result in M2 expansion, improving overall market liquidity and risk-on sentiment.

ETF net outflows have been gradually declining, indicating that selling pressure is easing. A shift from net outflows to net inflows will signal a renewed phase of institutional demand, which reinforces the right-translated scenario. If these factors align positively, Bitcoin will follow historical cycle timing, with a potential cycle peak in early Q4 2025.

**CONCLUSION**

Both a **right- and left-translated cycle scenario can be supported by strong arguments**, reflecting the marketâ€™s current state of macroeconomic uncertainty. Core macro indicators have yet to establish sustained long-term trends, which may be attributed to the new U.S. administrationâ€™s mixed and partly contradictory policies. However, such uncertainty is not uncommon in early post-election years. Ultimately, the **key determining factor will be the trajectory of monetary policy leading into summer 2025**, particularly whether M2 Global expands, as historical data suggests a strong correlation between its growth and Bitcoin price developments.

So far, the Fed has refrained from reintroducing rate hikes, primarily due to stabilizing unemployment rates. Additionally, **declining inflation** supports the case for further rate cuts. **If this trend continues and unemployment remains stable or declines, the probability of monetary easing increases, strengthening the foundation for a right-translated cycle with renewed, growing demand.**

**However, the long-term economic implications of the administrationâ€™s policies, particularly its re-industrialization agenda and reshoring efforts, must be closely monitored.** Recent layoffs and potential increases in the unemployment rate can negatively impact sentiment, reducing the probability of expansionary fiscal policies. Additionally, the introduction of new tariffs introduces further uncertainty. While tariffs may temporarily boost domestic employment, the higher import costs can drive inflation higher, potentially delaying Fed rate cuts and tightening liquidity conditions.

**From mid-April 2025, with fresh labor market and inflation data available, along with another Fed testimony, the probabilities of a left- versus right-translated cycle will become clearer.**

TL;DR: Bitcoinâ€™s cycle hinges on macro conditions & liquidity. A Right-Translated Cycle means more upside into 2025-2026, while a Left-Translated Cycle suggests Bitcoin already peaked in Q1 2025. Declining inflation and stable or falling unemployment increase the likelihood of rate cuts, reinforcing a right-translated cycle with renewed demand.

# Recap on Bitcoinâ€™s Market Cycles

Bitcoin follows a **four-year cycle**, historically peaking **12-18 months post-halving**. But **this cycle is different** \- Bitcoin hit an **all-time high BEFORE the halving** for the first time ever. The current cycle (measured from the last bottom) began in early November 2022.

[Four-Year Bitcoin Market Cycles](https://preview.redd.it/myg9i7o022pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=10ce38747b85d91dfbd4cd2637fea76b28f3e019)

**I assume two market cycle scenarios:**

* **Right-Translated Cycle (Bullish)** â†’ Extended uptrend, peak closer to 2025-2026
* **Left-Translated Cycle (Bearish)** â†’ Early peak, prolonged downturn

# ðŸ”¥ So, which one are we in?

In the following let's take a look on key indicators driving Bitcoin's market cycle and examine their current trends, outlooks, and potential macroeconomic implications.

**1. M2 Global Supply (Liquidity)**

* Expanding again but slower than previous cycles
* If liquidity continues rising, it supports a **right-translated cycle**

[M2 Global Supply \(taken from 21 central banks\)](https://preview.redd.it/yuncc5l232pe1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffdf1fdca08946f6d1b638268f5a65028336af21)

**2. Core PCE Inflation (Fedâ€™s Key Inflation Measure)**

* Inflation still above 2% target but declining
* Fed policy decisions and unemployment trends will determine whether inflation stabilizes or rebounds. The risk of stagflation needs to be monitored.
* If inflation remains sticky, Fed may delay rate cuts â†’ **Left-Translated Cycle**

[Core PCE Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/frp70kgi32pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5afdeae5f6d18e5ce84f457f6834f6af2f770839)

**3. Unemployment Rate**

* Stabilized at 4.1%, but risks of job losses are rising
* Current U.S. administration's layoff policies need to be monitored (we'll know more with the upcoming jobs report on April 4, 2025)
* If inflation stays high despite rising unemployment, the Fed faces a tough choice: keep rates high, risking economic distress, or cut them to boost jobs while fueling inflation. This decision will be key to 2025's macro outlook.
* If unemployment spikes, Fed may cut rates sooner â†’ **Right-Translated Cycle**

[Unemployment Rate](https://preview.redd.it/qb6cd42742pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=85446f6e7dd379bb9e2e8d27811c9b7458952443)

**4. Fed Funds Rate**

* Rates Targets were cut to 4.50% but remain high
* If rate cuts accelerate, lending stimulation and credit expansion will increase overall liquidity in the financial system â†’ **Right-Translated Cycle**,
* If rates stay high â†’ **Left-Translated Cycle**

[Fed Funds Target Rates](https://preview.redd.it/19vu6haq42pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bc5fdf60703c5fd90fd2573156725e33f7c1073)

**5. NASDAQ Composite (Stock Market Correlation)**

* Peaked in **Dec 2024**, currently declining
* Historically, Bitcoinâ€™s price has exhibited a strong correlation with equities. A downturn in equity markets can lead to weakened investor confidence in speculative assets, increasing selling pressure on cryptocurrencies, particularly in a left-translated cycle.
* If stocks rebound â†’ Bitcoin follows (bullish)
* If stocks keep dropping â†’ Bitcoin likely enters **Left-Translated Cycle**

Lastly, I examined ETF Net Flows, which have been crucial this cycle and closely correlate with price action.

**6. ETF Net Flows (Institutional Demand)**

* **Net inflows turned negative in Feb 2025**
* The significant outflows observed since late February 2025 suggest waning institutional confidence in the market. If net flows remain negative for an extended period, this can serve as a bearish signal, indicating sustained selling pressure and potential downside risk.
* If inflows resume â†’ **Right-Translated Cycle**
* If outflows continue â†’ **Left-Translated Cycle**

[ETF Net Flows](https://preview.redd.it/t7fiovhr72pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=28bd484c9775f074223503953cd6fac22a756e81)

# Let's discuss the scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Left-Translated Cycle Scenario**

With Bitcoin reflecting risk-off sentiment since February 2025, the likelihood of a left-translated cycle has become increasingly relevant. In contrast to previous post-halving cycles, where Bitcoinâ€™s peak typically occurred 12â€“18 months after the halving, this scenario suggests that Bitcoin may have already reached its cycle high on January 20, 2025. By continuously delaying further rate cuts, the Fed keeps liquidity tight and weakening stock markets drag Bitcoin lower. This means, the market is about to enter a prolonged bear phase lasting up to 1.5 years, if aligning with the time frames observed in the last two cycles.

**Supporting arguments for Scenario 1:**

* **ETF adoption absorbed liquidity too early.** The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 led to massive institutional inflows in Q3 and Q4 2024. Bitcoin ETFs absorbed liquidity during a phase of expanding M2 Global Supply, creating an early demand surge that front-loaded buying pressure and was unique to this cycle.
* **Bitcoin reached an all-time high before the halving.** In all previous cycles, Bitcoinâ€™s all-time high (ATH) came 12-18 months after the halving. This cycle, Bitcoin hit an ATH at $73K$ before the April 2024 halving - a first in Bitcoinâ€™s history.
* **Liquidity tightened post-Q2 2024.** While M2 Global expanded during Q1 and Q2 2024, liquidity conditions tightened in Q3 and Q4 as the Fed maintained high interest rates and repeatedly postponed rate cuts before finally lowering rates to 475 bps in December 2024.
* **ETF netflows have turned negative.** Since February 2025, ETF Net Flows turned negative, suggesting institutions are de-risking or taking profits.
* **NASDAQ Composite and Bitcoin are showing correlated weakness.** Historically, Bitcoin has followed a risk-on/risk-off pattern with equities. The NAS- DAQ Composite peaked in Q4 2024, and since then, market sentiment has weakened.
* **Quantitative Easing is not the Fedâ€™s tool of choice.** The Fed has not signaled any immediate plans for Quantitative Easing (QE).

What's the current price of iPhone 16e? 0.007 bi... No, it costs 7 millibit!

0.01 - bitcent

0.001 - millibit

0.000001 - microbit

0.00000001 - satoshi",-0.5411

2025-03-16,BTC trading volume in November,"This is nothing more than curiosity. 

Recently I started to pay attention to trading volume of Bitcoin and I noticed it's insanely low (less than 1% of market cap). And that made me wonder, how did it look in the past? Like during rally in November. I can imagine it was way bigger, but how much exactly? In recent weeks I noticed that volume increased to max 70 billion (vs 11,6 billion right now).

If I interpret it correctly, most of Bitcoin as of right now is owned by the whales or other institutions and I wonder if that may hamper future growth?
